# Centola 2007 -  Complex contagions and the weakness of long ties

- 'strength of weak ties'
- does it generalize simple to complex contagions
  - complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources
- as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion
  - complex contagions depend primarily on the width of bridges across a network
  - not just length

- this work seems like a direct extension to the watts paper

# Centola 2005 - The emperor's dilemma

- ABM
- agents must decide whether to comply with and enforce a norm that is supported by a few fanatics and opposed by the vast majority
- cannot occur in fully connected social network
- if agent's horizons are limited to immediate neighbors, unpopular norms can emerge locally and then spreads

- paper can be extended/related to echo chambers

# Lopez-Pintado 2008 - Social influence, binary decisions, and collective dynamics

- how social influence determines collective outcomes for large populations of individuals faced with binary decisions
- influence-response function
  - 1D function of the (weighted) number of individuals choosing each of the alternatives
  - this seems similar to how we modeled the watts paper
  - some proportion of the number of neighbors that are different from you
- assumption of global and anonymous interactions  (what does this mean?)
  - sufficient to compute equilibrium
  - even non-equilibrium properties of the collective dynamics
- compare classes of decisions

# Biggs 2005 - Strikes as forest fires

- 'strikes' to wildfires, avalanches, and epidemics
- power-law distribution of event sizes
- events follow a power law spanning 2 or 3 orders of magnitude

# Chiang 2007 - Bords of moderately different feathers

- bandwagon dynamics in social networks
- Granovetter's 1978 threshold model (!)
- pattern of social ties connecting actors with different participation thresholds
  - potentially tie this paper into our mann model extension of watts
- participation levels increase when network structure departs from pure homophily
	- similar finding/ fundamental component in the watts model
- heterogeneity of network neighbors causes the bandwagon effects to wane
- balance of hetero/homo in social networks

# Smith 2012 - Macrostructure from Microstructure

- "new simulation method to make global network inference from sampled data"
- sampled ego network data and uses exponential random graph models to reconstruct the feature of the true unknown network
- Add health, sociology co-authorship networks
- global network inference
  - distance
  - main compnent size

# Morales 2014 - Efficiency of human activity on information spreading on Twitter

- collective reaction to individual actions key to info spread in social media
- efficiency on twitter: ratio between the emergent spreading process and the activity employed by the user
-some influential users efficiently cause remarkable collective reactions
- others employ extremely larger efforts
- model to reproduce retweet cascades
  - emergent distribution of user efficiency
- dynamical patterns of conversations are strongly conditioned by the topology of the underlying network
- heterogeneity is a key component

# Gibson 2005 - Network scheduling and its consequences for diffusion

- scheduling for network diffusion
- scheduling 2 people for a dyadic encounter means simultaneous availability for interaction
- scheduling process with contagion
- interaction of network topology, contagion rule (contact vs threshold), scheduling imperfections
- scheduling turns central actors into bottlenecks
- can also trigger early adoption
  - early adoption is also an analogy made in the watts paper

# Neill 2005 - Cascade effects in heterogeneous populations

- sequential choice explains emergence of unpopular/inefficient behavioral norms
- individuals modeled as naive Bayesian norm followers
- Bayesian reasoning to combine private preferences and prior beliefs with observations
- when infer preferences of others form observation, negative cascades
  - majority of agents to choose dis-preferred action
- negative cascades can happen even when degree of conformity is low
  - heterogeneity
  - priors
  - public opinion

# Corten 2013 - Alcohol use among adolescents as a coordination problem in a dynamic network

- game-theoretical approach
- predictions on the effects of macro-level social network structure on usage rates
- coordination problem
  - risk dominant
  - inefficient behavior
- initial network density predicts 'catalyzing'
- centralization could not be confirmed
  - centralization? as in node with high degree?

# Centola 2015 - The social origins of networks and diffusion

- network topologies are not given a priori
- model of social network formation
  - social and structural constraints on tie formation
- Blau and Schwartz
- high levels of consolidation can create balkanized communities with poor integration of shared norms and practices
  - similar to echo chambers?
- reducing consolidation creates more crosscutting circles and significantly improves the dynamics of social diffusion
- further reducing consolidation creates highly intersecting social networks that fail to support widespread diffusion
  - moderate to high levels of structural consolidation
- what is consolidation?
